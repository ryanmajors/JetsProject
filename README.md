# Jets Project

## Description

If you've ever wanted the chance to command your own airfield, well nows your chance!

MIA is currently in a pilot program where civilians may control what happens. This may be a great idea or a bad one... Let's find out!

## Functionality

You begin by launching the program at which time, your airfield is populated with 5 jets for you to play with. Once the jets populate, you are prompted with a variety of options. As you sift through your choices in the main menu, you can display your entire fleet and fly them all. You can view your fastest jet along with your farthest traveling jet. You can even load cargo onto them as well as prepare and launch them to engage in battle. Lastly, if you want to customize your fleet, you have the ability to add and remove 3 types of jets to and from your fleet. Once you are done living the experience you may choose to exit the program and quit. 

## Lessons Learned

This project has to date, been my biggest one. Moving into my 4th week of SD, I can definitely say that I learned the most while doing this project.I learned several key concepts that helped me complete this project. First was solidifying my understanding of how OOP truly works. Up until this project I was still a little shaky on how it all worked. But this project really forced me to look deeper and grasp how different classes and objects work in harmony in OOP. Secondly, I learned how important getters and setters are. In my previous project and quizzes, i really wasn't utilizing them to my benefit. Once I was able to get a functioning project that met all of the story goals, it was time for me to work on how it looked to you the user. In doing this, I realized how important the use of getters and setters are in displaying data how you would like. I see how this can also be beneficial for using in not just your print statements, but in your methods as well. Lastly, I learned that I am not alone in my struggle of learning Java. I was able to assist several of my teammates that were struggling to complete their projects. In doing so, I further concreted my understanding of OOP by being able to explain in my own words how it all works together with those I was helping being able to understand my explanations.
